<p class="paragraphs">Hello my name is Ivan. I am in 9th grade, I live in South San Fransico, I go to Summit Shasta, I have been living in California for the majority of my life. I have 2 sisters they are both younger than I am. Their names are Danika and Daniela. </p>

<p class="paragraphs">My favorite food is pizza, my favorite movie is Pacific Rim. </p>

<p class="paragraphs">I like pizza because it tastes great but I do like Italian food the best in general. I like Pacific Rim because it was a pretty creative idea and I really liked it.</p>
