    <h1>The Hardware</h1>
    
    <h2 id="motherboard">Motherboard</h2>
<p>One of the most important pieces of hardware is the motherboard and the mother board controls everything in the computer. </p>
<p>The mother board is like the spine for a computer. It is essential for it to function. The motherboard serves as the central circuit hub that connects all the peripherals and components of a computer. It also regulates the power received by the hard drive, graphics card, CPU and system memory from the power supply. It is a key piece of computer hardware that can be viewed as the "backbone" of the entire computer system. </p>

<h2 id="CPU">CPU</h2>
<p> What the abriviations of CPU stand for are Central Processing Unit. The CPU is one of most most important parts of the computer because without the CPU the computer wouldn't be able to run or send messages into the computer from one end to the other. Arithmetic and makes logical decisions at speeds up to billions of operations per second.</p>

<h2 id="ram">RAM</h2>
<p>The ram of the computer is an important part for it to run. It's also known as Random Access Memeory. It is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved from the computer. The reason why computers do have RAM is because it stores all lost data into the computer when the computer has no power. The RAM is used by the CPU when the computer is running to store information that needs to be used very quickly, but does not store the information permanetly.</p>

<h2 id="harddrive">Hard drive </h2>
<p>The hard drive also know as the hard disk drive, is one of the most essential parts of the computers because it is basically where all the data or files is stored. A high-capacity, self-contained storage device containing a read-write mechanism plus one or more hard disks, inside a sealed unit.  </p>
